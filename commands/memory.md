description: Load your project memory to remember previous work
---

Load the complete project memory using the `contox_get_memory` tool. This retrieves all stored context from previous sessions including architecture decisions, implementation notes, conventions, bug fixes, and session history.

After loading, briefly summarize what you found (number of sub-contexts, key topics covered) so the user knows their memory is active.

If $ARGUMENTS is not empty, search the loaded memory for information related to "$ARGUMENTS" and highlight relevant findings.
