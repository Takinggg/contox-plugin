description: Save this session's work into persistent project memory
---

Save the current session's work into persistent project memory using the `contox_save_session` tool.

Review the conversation history and identify:
1. **Architecture changes** — new patterns, stack decisions, infrastructure changes
2. **Implementation work** — features built, components created, APIs added
3. **Conventions** — coding patterns established, naming rules, style decisions
4. **Decisions** — key choices with rationale (why X over Y)
5. **Bug fixes** — bugs found and how they were fixed, edge cases discovered
6. **Todo items** — pending tasks, known issues, planned improvements

Create a concise summary (1-3 sentences) of what was accomplished, then organize the changes into the appropriate categories.

If $ARGUMENTS is not empty, use "$ARGUMENTS" as additional context for the summary.

Be specific — include file paths, function names, and concrete details that will be useful in future sessions.
